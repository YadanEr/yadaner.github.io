        <div>

            <ol>
                <li><h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first thing I noticed was a huge image that cover the whole webpage. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, I entered the webpage, and my mouse formed a cross then I moved over the image in the center of the page, and it started to create an effect on the cross that was like a drip of oil into the water.</li>
                        <li>Then, I observed the whole format and layout of the project and considered the elements that can be interacted with.</li>  
                        <li>The title of the webpage is over the top right of the page. A few different images on the top of the webpage, and a “control” box beside the page.</li>
                        <li>After that, I adjusted each of the parameters on the control box, and then move the mouse on the webpage to see the changes. There is a “reset” bottom on the end of the parameter.</li>
                        <li>I noticed that when I stop the mouse on the image, the area around the cross shows an effect like ripping water. After I moved the mouse, the trace of the mouse display a shallow line, and the image changed along the track of the mouse.</li>
                        <li>In the end, I found that there was a sound symbol on the right bottom of the webpage, but I didn’t experiment with it.</li>
                        <li>(After the experience on the webpage, I googled the title “Liquid Entropy” meaning.)</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I spend the most time on the “CONTROLS” center, there were 9 adjustments that can be discovered. Each adjustment can change the effort of the mouse on the image.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most common action should be for the mouse to adjust each parameter, and then test how it could change the image. The repeated action was moving the mouse left and right, then tested on the image.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My impression of the intended primary goal is the project has various ways to interact with users, such as special animations and quick expressions of response.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interactive experience should communicate its primary goal understandably, and guide users to the right interaction ways. The most important feature of an interactive project is it can attract users' attention. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To make sure the quality of the experience and the user feel get into the experience, the experience should be tested about 5min each time.</li>
                            When I first entered the website, I confused about what concept is the page developing. I spend 5min to play around the webpage and tried every area that I can click and open, also I researched the meaning of Liquid Entropy, which I understand is a chemical change on the image.
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In my impression, the interactive experience should provide positive interaction and timely feedback to guide the player towards the goals of the interaction. Establishing a connection with the users could make the project have longer profits.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        The experience also includes some other media forms:
                        <li>Animation: The image could change form when the mouse drags in it. (Liquid Entropy is kind to chemical change)</li> 
                        <li>Lighting: The lighting effect on the image will change with the animation change.</li> 
                        <li>Audio: The background music and the effects of sound.</li>
                        <li>The title used an art font.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>•	The reference suggests to me that when I engage with an interactive project, I should try all the elements that I can interact with, and at the same time I could guess the producer’s expression.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To explore an interactive project, there should be a sense of interaction and participation. While providing multiple ways of interaction, users can interact and give feedback on the interactive items, which will also stimulate a comfortable and pleasant mood.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The element that frustrated me the most was when I adjusted parameters and they didn't show on the image. After I explored “CONTROL”, I think the value fluctuation may too small when adjusting the parameters. For example, to display the size of the cross mouse on the image, it is necessary to adjust the value with a big difference to see the contrast.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The most satisfying part for me was the animation of this interactive project. When I move the mouse to the image, the webpage can respond quickly and give corresponding interactive forms and animations, that I feel involved and engaged into this interactive experience.</li>
                    </ul>
